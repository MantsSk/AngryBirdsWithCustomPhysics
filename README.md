Sample C# project for an internal Unity lecture in 2018. The following project uses Mantas Puida custom Physics engine made for our internal learning.


Following engine description: 

This is a super-simple C# "game" + "physics engine" _(just a bunch of sprites moving around with very small amount of logic really)_. I made to
show how one might do simple 2D physics engine from scratch.

The example project should work on Unity 2018.2.x and later.

I used some resources to make life easier for me here:

* Sprites used by "the game" I took from Dan Cook's [Space Cute prototyping challenge](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/03/spacecute-prototyping-challenge.html).
* It is somewhat successor to [Aras presentation on DoD](https://github.com/aras-p/dod-playground).
* Circle collision impulse resolution was inspired by great [Randy Gaul's post](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-2d-physics-engine-the-basics-and-impulse-resolution--gamedev-6331).
